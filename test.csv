"One very important skill that a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today is the ability to communicate effectively. Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, and thoughts with others, and it is an essential skill in almost every aspect of life. Whether we are trying to persuade others to support our ideas, negotiate a deal, or simply get our point across, effective communication is crucial to our success.",1
"Finally, after overcome difficult situations people are able to handle any problem in a better way because they are already familiar dealing with unpleasant experiences. My own case illustrates it. After loosing my mother and being a teacher without previous experience, I have developed skills like control of stress and work under pressure that has allowed me to face any problem o challenge.",0
"In general, though, the increased life expectancy owes much to the revolution in communication. It may be mentioned that even two hundred years ago, inventions and discoveries were being made. However, they did few people any good. It simply took too long to disseminate the information. The general level of awareness regarding health was also low. However, it has been noticed that since the inception of communication through first print, and then radio and television, the level of awareness regarding health has generally risen. To illustrate, print facilitated the spread of knowledge through books. Radio helped bring that knowledge to many people. Television helped to further this knowledge and disseminate is amongst an even greater number of people. And finally, the Internet has removed the final barriers between intercultural and interracial communication. In the coming years, we may hope to see an even greater increase in life expectancy, even as communication techniques continue to improve.",0
"Mesopotamia is a region in Western Asia that's historically significant due to its location within the Tigris-Euphrates river system. Today, modern Iraq is considered Mesopotamia, but in the past, it also included parts of Iran, Syria, Kuwait, and Turkey. The Sumerians and Akkadians, from present-day Iraq, were in control of Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history until the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was taken over by the Achaemenid Empire. It was then ruled by Alexander the Great, then became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire. Later, the Arameans dominated much of the area. Mesopotamia is recognized as the birthplace of some of the earliest civilizations of the world and is responsible for some of the most important developments in human history, including the wheel, cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture. Over the centuries, the region was controlled by various empires, including the Parthians, the Romans, and the Sassanid Persians. A number of Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra.",1
"Josep ""Pep"" Guardiola Sala is a Spanish professional football manager and former player, who is the current manager of Premier League club Manchester City. He is considered one of the greatest managers of all time and holds the records for the most consecutive league games won in La Liga, the Bundesliga and the Premier League.

Guardiola was a defensive midfielder who usually played in a deep-lying playmaker's role. He spent the majority of his career with Barcelona, forming a part of Johan Cruyff's Dream Team that won the club's first European Cup in 1992, and four successive Spanish league titles from 1991 to 1994. He captained the team from 1997 until his departure from the club in 2001. Guardiola then had stints with Brescia and Roma in Italy, Al-Ahli in Qatar, and Dorados de Sinaloa in Mexico. He was capped 47 times for the Spanish national team and appeared at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as well as at UEFA Euro 2000. He also played friendly matches for Catalonia.

After retiring as a player, Guardiola briefly coached Barcelona B, with whom he won a Tercera División title. He took charge of the first-team in 2008. In his first season, he led Barcelona to the treble of La Liga, UEFA Champions League, and the Copa del Rey, becoming the youngest manager to win the aforementioned European competition. In 2011, after leading the club to another La Liga and Champions League double, Guardiola was awarded the Catalan Parliament's Gold Medal, their highest honour. The same year, he was also named the FIFA World Coach of the Year. He ended his four-year Barcelona stint in 2012 with 14 honours, a club record.

After a sabbatical period, Bayern Munich announced Guardiola would join the club as manager in 2013. Guardiola won the Bundesliga in each of his three seasons as Bayern manager, including two domestic doubles. He left the Bavarians for Manchester City in 2016, and guided them to a Premier League title in his second campaign in charge, breaking numerous domestic records as the team became the first to attain 100 league points. To date, he has won four Premier League titles, four EFL Cups, and the FA Cup, including a domestic treble in the 2018–19 season. He also led the club to their maiden UEFA Champions League Final in 2021.",0
"Ludwig van Beethoven was a talented German composer and pianist who is still widely admired today. He wrote many classical music pieces that are frequently performed, and his career is typically divided into three periods: early, middle, and late. During his early period, he honed his skills, and in his middle period, he developed his own unique style, which is sometimes referred to as ""heroic."" Around this time, he began to experience hearing loss. His late period was marked by continued experimentation and innovation. Beethoven was born in Bonn and showed his musical talent at an early age. His father was a harsh instructor, but he later benefited from the guidance of his teacher Christian Gottlob Neefe. He found refuge in the home of a family who he befriended and shared his love of music with. In his early twenties, he moved to Vienna, where he studied with Joseph Haydn and gained a reputation as an excellent pianist. He premiered several major works, including symphonies and concertos, despite his worsening deafness. He suffered from health issues and romantic disappointments, but he continued to compose, producing some of his most acclaimed pieces in his later years. He died in 1827, leaving behind an enduring legacy of music.",1
"Alchemy is an ancient practice that combines science, philosophy and spirituality. It originated in Egypt and then spread to Europe during the Middle Ages. Alchemy was all about transforming base metals into precious metals like gold and also finding the elixir of life that would grant immortality.

Alchemy was not just about the literal transformation of metals, but also about the transformation of the self. Alchemists believed that by transmuting base metals, they could purify themselves and become more enlightened. The practice focuses on the interconnectedness of all things and the idea that everything in the universe is connected through a spiritual force.

Alchemists used a variety of symbols and tools to help them in their search for transmutation. They used flasks and retorts to contain and heat their experiments, and symbols such as the sun and moon, the four elements and the symbol for mercury to represent their theories and ideas.

Alchemy played an important role in the development of modern science. Many alchemists were also scientists who made significant contributions to fields such as chemistry, medicine, physics and astronomy. They discovered new elements and compounds, developed new medicines and invented new techniques for scientific experimentation.

Although alchemy is no longer practiced in the same way today, some of its principles and practices still hold relevance. Modern alchemists focus on the spiritual and transformative aspects of the practice, using meditation and ritual to bring about inner transformation and personal growth.

In conclusion, alchemy was a complex practice that combined science, philosophy and spiritualism. It sought to transform base metals into precious metals, as well as to purify the self and find enlightenment. Though it is no longer practiced in the same way today, its legacy lives on in modern science and spirituality.",1
"However, job security tends to lead to decreased productivity. In general, employees who are certain that they can never lose their jobs tend to work less efficiently, thereby contributing to an overall reduction of productivity in the company. A common example all over the world is that of civil servants. In Thailand, for example, many government workers are so indolent that it can take days or months for something to be finished that should only take a few days. It is not uncommon to walk into a government office and see employees filing their nails, making personal calls on the telephone, taking three-hour lunches, or surfing the Internet for fun.",0
"Chromosomes are one of the fundamental units of life. They are found in nearly all living organisms and play a vital role in passing genetic information from one generation to the next. Specifically, chromosomes are long strands of DNA that are wound tightly together, forming a compact structure that fits neatly inside the nucleus of a cell.

In humans, each cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46. The first 22 pairs are known as autosomes and are identical in both males and females. The 23rd pair, however, determines an individual's sex. Females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y chromosome.

The precise arrangement and structure of chromosomes play a critical role in genetic inheritance. During cell division, chromosomes replicate and then divide in a process called mitosis. This ensures that each new cell receives the correct number and arrangement of chromosomes. Errors in this process can result in genetic disorders or diseases.

Additionally, chromosomes undergo a special type of division called meiosis during the formation of sex cells. This process shuffles the genetic material, allowing for new combinations of genes to be passed on to offspring.

Overall, chromosomes are incredibly important for our understanding of genetics and the transmission of traits from one generation to the next.",1
"The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend"".",0
"Although there are also disadvantages in big cities such as social evils, environmental pollution, and noise... living in big cities is still dream of many people. It is better for children to grow up in big cities and have weekends in the countryside enjoying fresh air than live in the countryside and rarely come to city. In brief, children can develop comprehensively when living in big city.",0

"Diatoms are a type of unicellular algae that are found in various aquatic environments all over the world. They are characterized by their unique silica cell walls, which form intricate patterns known as frustules.

Diatoms play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems as primary producers, providing a significant portion of the oxygen and organic matter that supports aquatic food webs.

Due to their distinctive frustules, diatoms are used extensively in environmental monitoring, paleoclimate research, and industrial applications such as water purification and abrasives production.

Despite their microscopic size, diatoms have a significant impact on our planet's ecology and are an essential part of the global carbon cycle.",1
"On the other hand, friends can also be a significant influence on young adults. Friends often serve as a source of social support, companionship, and identity formation during this developmental stage. For example, a young adult who has a group of supportive friends may feel more confident and secure in their identity, while a young adult who lacks supportive friends may feel isolated and vulnerable.",1

"Kolkata is a city that is full of life. Here, unlike any other city in India, people are cooperative and one can enjoy one's joy and happiness in company of others. In Kolkata, help is always available, even if one does not ask for it. This is really a unique feature of Kolkata, which makes it a different city. One can enjoy the festivals to the full extent of one's desire. During the festivals people come closer, even if they are not known to each other. It is the mood during the festivals, which brings all the Kolkata together.",0
"Overall, the internet has had a profound impact on society, and its benefits are far-reaching.

"Attila, known as Attila the Hun, ruled the Huns from 434 until he passed away in March 453. He was the leader of a tribal empire that included the Huns, Ostrogoths, Alans, and Bulgars, among others, in Central and Eastern Europe, and is regarded as one of the most powerful rulers in history.

Throughout his reign, Attila was a feared opponent of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. He led the Huns in cross the Danube on two occasions and carrying out pillages of the Balkans, though he was unsuccessful in capturing Constantinople. His conquest in Persia was not fruitful, but his victory in 441 against the Eastern Roman Empire gave him the courage to invade the West. He also aimed to conquer Roman Gaul, however, he was stopped at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains after crossing the Rhine in 451 and marching as far as Aurelianum.

Later, he attacked Italy, causing damage to the northern provinces, but failed to conquer Rome. He planned for future campaigns against the Romans, but he perished in 453. Following Attila's death, his right-hand man, Ardaric of the Gepids, triggered a Germanic uprising against Hunnic rule, leading to the prompt demise of the Hunnic Empire. Even after his death, Attila remained a character in Germanic heroic tales.",1
"There is no doubt that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are important for the functioning and development of society. However, I disagree with the idea that these needs should be prioritized over saving land for endangered animals. There are several reasons why preserving land for endangered species is important and should not be overlooked.",1
"I think I would prefer to hurry to get things done than to take my time and live life at a slower pace because it allows me to do things over a short period of time, make my self available for opportunities and it makes one to be efficient in life.",0
"On the other hand, it is also important to recognize that external appearances can sometimes provide valuable information about a person. For example, if a person is dressed in a uniform or is wearing a name tag, it is reasonable to assume that they are affiliated with a particular organization or profession. Similarly, if a person is wearing clothing or accessories that convey a certain message, it is reasonable to assume that they are trying to communicate something about themselves.",1
"Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to support the factory will depend on the specific circumstances of the community and the willingness of the company to address and mitigate any potential negative impacts.

"Chemical synthesis refers to the process of creating new and useful compounds through chemical reactions. Typically, this involves combining various molecules and elements together in specific ways to create something new, often with a specific purpose or function in mind.

Chemical synthesis has numerous applications in modern society, ranging from pharmaceuticals to plastics and other materials. In pharmaceuticals, chemical synthesis is often used to create new drugs that can treat diseases or alleviate symptoms. In plastics and materials, chemical synthesis can be used to create strong and durable compounds that can be used for a wide range of purposes.

The process of chemical synthesis can be quite complex and requires a deep understanding of chemistry and chemical reactions. Researchers must carefully plan and execute experiments to ensure that the desired outcome is achieved, and must also be able to identify and isolate compounds as they are created.

In recent years, advances in technology have made chemical synthesis faster and more efficient than ever before. Automation and robotics, for example, have made it possible to conduct experiments at a much faster pace than before, while sophisticated computer software can help researchers predict the outcomes of various chemical reactions.

Despite these advances, chemical synthesis remains an essential tool for scientists and researchers who are exploring the frontiers of science and technology. By creating new compounds and materials, these researchers are helping to push the limits of what is possible in fields ranging from medicine to engineering and beyond.",1
"The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of all the known chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configurations, and chemical properties. It is one of the most important tools in chemistry and is used to predict how atoms will react with each other and form compounds.

The periodic table was first proposed by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, who organized the elements based on their atomic weight and chemical properties. Since then, the table has been revised and expanded as new elements have been discovered.

The table is divided into rows, known as periods, which are arranged according to the number of electrons in the outermost shell of the atoms. These electrons, known as valence electrons, are responsible for the chemical properties of the elements.

The columns are known as groups, and each group contains elements with similar chemical properties. For example, Group 1 elements are all highly reactive and form strong bases when they react with water.

The periodic table has many practical applications, such as predicting the properties of elements we haven't yet discovered and understanding the behavior of complex chemical reactions. It is also used in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to electronics to agriculture.

Overall, the periodic table is a fundamental part of chemistry and has played a crucial role in our understanding of the natural world.",1
"Finally, attending a live performance can simply be more memorable and special than watching the same event on television.

"Moreover, students can now have the options to choose which university they prefer and take courses, which they really like.",0
"With this in mind I decided that letting the school chose someone for me is not a good idea. Also, it would be so much better if I chose someone for myself because I have a lot of rules that govern my life and I expect whoever I live with to follow them. I sleep very early at night, something that many young people I know don't do. There is no guarantee that the person the school chooses for me is going to sleep as early as I do, therefore the most logical option is for me to find someone that can fit my needs. Also I am a vegetarian, and the slightest smell of meat anywhere around the house can make me get very sick, so I need to be sure that the person I live with either is a vegetarian like myself or is going to remember never to bring meat around me. The most important factor in me wanting to choose a roommate of my own is the fact that I love animals. Wherever I have lived, I have always had at least three cats living with me. I love animals so much and I possibly cannot live without them. Not everyone however shares this same passion that I do, infect, many young people do not have time to care for pets, and don't especially like them, or worst, are allergic to them. For this reason I need to find someone that shares this passion with me, or at least doesn't mind having pets around the house. If the school was to choose someone with whom I was so live, then for all I know, it could be someone who cannot stand the sight of pets.",0
It surprises me that no one ever asks such questions from famous people. People like to interview a famous person and ask all sorts of personal questions. I think that asking this single question and carefully observing the speaker can actually reveal a lot about the speaker's personality and outlook than asking personal questions. This is because famous people might become somewhat defensive and not entirely honest when asked to describe their personality traits or likes/dislikes. But asking them about their outlook about life gives them space to talk about a lot more than just answering some to-the-point questions.,0
"In my opinion, the most important characteristic a person can have to be successful in life is determination. Determination is the quality that allows an individual to stay focused and motivated, even in the face of challenges and setbacks. It is the driving force behind a person's ability to achieve their goals and achieve success.",1
"Second, a research center focused on agriculture would have the opportunity to address some of the pressing issues facing the industry in [your country]. For example, our country may be facing challenges such as drought, pests, or soil degradation, and a research center focused on agriculture could work on finding solutions to these problems. This would not only benefit the agriculture industry, but it would also have a positive impact on the environment and the well-being of our citizens.",1
"Queen is a legendary British rock band that has left a lasting impression on the music industry since their formation in 1970. With Freddie Mercury on lead vocals, Brian May on guitar, John Deacon on bass, and Roger Taylor on drums, the band's musical style is known for fusion rock, hard rock, and heavy metal.

The band's popularity skyrocketed after the 1975 release of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which is regarded as one of the greatest songs of all time. The song is known for its exquisite vocal harmonies, unconventional structure, and sweeping operatic sections. Released on the album ""A Night at the Opera,"" the song and the album secured the band's place in history, earning them legions of new fans across the world.

Queen's extensive discography boasts hits such as ""We Are the Champions,"" ""We Will Rock You,"" ""Don't Stop Me Now,"" and ""Another One Bites the Dust."" The band's music has been featured in many films, TV shows, and commercials, keeping the band relevant in popular culture even decades after their formation.

In addition to their music, Queen was renowned for their iconic live concerts. With Mercury's flamboyance and showmanship, the band put on some of the most visually stunning and musically stunning live shows that music fans have ever witnessed. Their performances at Wembley Stadium in 1986 and Live Aid in 1985 are still talked about to this day.

Despite Freddie Mercury's untimely death in 1991, the band's legacy lives on. The remaining members continue to perform under the band name, collaborating with other artists and touring worldwide. Their influence on the music industry is undeniable, inspiring many artists to this day. Queen will forever be regarded as one of the most successful and influential rock bands of all time.",1
"Optional attendance to classes at universities has been an increasingly popular way for students to study for several years in quite a few countries. However, it has not yet had its intended results as it had been hoped. In fact, today, this system seems to be one of the reasons for the corruption of university education. In my opinion, compulsory attendance is better than having no requirement to attend all the lessons on-campus.",0

"One of the main ways that computers have made life easier is by automating tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming and labor-intensive. For example, with just a few clicks, we can now book a flight or make a hotel reservation online, rather than spending hours on the phone or in line at a travel agency. Computers have also made it easier for people to work from home, allowing them to save time and money on commuting and providing more flexibility in their schedules.",1
"Some people think that children should begin their education as early in their lives as possible, while others think that children should spend most of their time playing. Each opinion could be supported by a number of arguments. However, it is my opinion that playing is more important activity than learning for children during their early years.",0
"An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.

At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides.

In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.",0
"When children attend school, they spend most of their time with their classmates. Because of this reason many people think that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child’s success in school. I totally agree with this statement in the light of my experiences and my other friends’ experiences. In this essay, I will try to figure out how classmates are an important influence on a child’s success in school.",0
"Another reason I prefer to travel alone is that it allows me to fully immerse myself in the experience of being in a new place. When I am with a companion, I often find myself spending more time interacting with them and less time observing and experiencing my surroundings. When I am alone, I have the opportunity to truly take in everything that a new place has to offer and fully engage with the culture and people around me.",1

"3. Other factors should be considered when determining teacher pay: There are many factors that should be taken into account when determining teacher pay, such as their level of education, years of experience, and the demand for their subject area. Additionally, teachers often go above and beyond their job duties, taking on extra responsibilities and working long hours outside of the classroom to ensure the success of their students. These extra efforts should also be considered when determining teacher pay.",1
"The Roman Republic is the period of ancient Roman civilization that began with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom in 509 BC and ended with the establishment of the Roman Empire in 27 BC.

During the Roman Republic, Rome was a city-state government headed by two consuls, who were elected officials chosen by the citizens. The consuls served as the highest political authority, presiding over the Senate, which was made up of aristocratic families.

The government of the Roman Republic was a complex system of checks and balances, with no single person holding absolute power. The Senate served as the legislative branch of government, with the power to make laws and approve or veto treaties.

The Roman Republic was marked by a series of conflicts both inside and outside the city of Rome. These conflicts included wars with other Italian city-states, as well as invasions by foreign powers such as the Carthaginians.

One of the most famous conflicts of the Roman Republic was the war with Carthage, known as the Punic Wars. These wars lasted for over 100 years and involved a series of battles and strategies that led to the eventual defeat of Carthage and the rise of Rome as a dominant power in the Mediterranean region.

The Roman Republic was also marked by significant social and economic changes, including the rise of the wealthy merchant class, the expansion of slavery, and the emergence of new religions such as Christianity.

Despite its many accomplishments, the Roman Republic ultimately gave way to the Roman Empire, which was characterized by a single ruler and a more centralized government. Nevertheless, the Roman Republic remains an important and influential period in world history, with its legacy still visible in modern political and social systems.",1
"A digital electronic device called a computer is capable of automatically carrying out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations through the use of programs. These programs enable computers to perform a vast array of tasks, and a computer system is considered to be complete when it includes the necessary hardware, operating system, and peripheral equipment for full functionality. This term can also refer to a group of interconnected computers, such as a computer cluster or network.

Computers are widely used control systems for both consumer and industrial products, ranging from simple remote controls and microwave ovens to complex factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design systems, as well as general-purpose devices such as personal computers and smartphones. The Internet, connecting billions of users and systems, is powered by computers.

The use of digital devices for calculations and long tedious tasks dates back to ancient times, with the abacus and industrial revolution-era mechanical devices. The development of digital electronic calculating machines during World War II, followed by the microprocessor and microcomputer revolution in the 1970s, dramatically increased the speed, power and versatility of computers. Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a microprocessor, along with computer memory and peripheral devices for input and output functions.",1
"Secondly, another reason why I disagree is that the chief goal of university education is to teach students working skills. Obviously, libraries provide more useful information to students than sports activities do. For example, more and more libraries are also equipped with computers, which can encourage students to surf the Net to widen their horizons. Without the Internet, there will be fewer chances to make friend with the foreigners and catch the latest worldwide information. On the contrary, sports activities are just limited in a small area and a few of friends in some degree.",0

"China, also known as the People's Republic of China, maintains full diplomatic relations with 178 out of the 193 member states of the United Nations, as well as Cook Islands, Niue, and the State of Palestine. Since 2019, China has had more diplomatic missions than any other country in the world.

China claims that it is committed to pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace. Its policy goals include preserving China's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, creating a positive international environment for the country's development and modernization, and contributing to global peace and development. As a result of this policy, China has chosen not to engage in diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the Republic of China as a separate nation.

China is a member of many international organizations and holds key positions, including a permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council.

"I consider that outward qualities are related in some ways to the manner we are and the way we feel inside. Sometimes the clothes we chose express our mood, how we are feeling at that moment. Also, the hairstyle, make up and many other aspects of our look sometimes give an idea of our attitude towards life. Even though, not all aspects or, for some people, any aspect of the personality is shown in external appearances.

"Mosques, also known as masjids, are places where Muslims go to pray. They can be covered buildings, but they can also be open spaces that are used for prayers. At first, mosques were simple places of prayer that might have been outdoors. Early mosques had both open and closed covered spaces enclosed by walls. They often had minarets where calls to prayer were made. Most mosque buildings have an ornamental niche indicating the direction of Mecca, ablution facilities, and a pulpit where the Friday sermon is delivered. Mosques usually have separate areas for men and women to pray. Different regions, time periods, and religious denominations affect the way the organization of a mosque might look. 

Aside from prayer services, mosques are used for a variety of activities such as Ramadan vigils, funerals, weddings, business deals, collecting and distributing charitable donations, and as homeless shelters. In the past, mosques were a community center, a court of law, and a religious school. Nowadays, they still serve as places of religious instruction and debate. The Great Mosque of Mecca, the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem are especially important. 

As Islam expanded, mosques became more common throughout the world. Some churches and temples were even converted into mosques, which added to Islamic architectural styles. In the past, most mosques were funded by charities, but now, private funding is becoming more common. Many privately funded mosques serve as bases for different Islamic revivalist movements and social activism. Mosques have played significant political roles, and the number of people who attend mosque services varies a lot depending on the region.",1

"The Premier League is the highest level of the men's English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League. Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches. Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.

The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky. From 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively. The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League clubs.

The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018–19 season, the average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the German Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021. The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in total.

Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City and Liverpool.",0
"A greater number of people are now hitting the eighty-year mark than ten years ago. In fact, the life expectancy of the average human has gone up considerably, and is rising still. This phenomenon is the result of several reasons. For one, continuing scientific and medical innovation ensure that more people receive the treatment they require. As our knowledge grows regarding various diseases, we become better equipped to tackle them. Consequently, we have managed to eradicate some diseases on a global scale, while controlling the other diseases, so that the rate of mortality does not reach an alarming height during the outbreak of a disease. The plagues of yore, as well as the more recent plague outbreaks are becoming few and far in between. Such control of diseases means that the general life expectancy has gone up.",0
"The Orthodox Church, also known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, consists of approximately 220 million baptized members, making it the second largest Christian church. It functions as a communion of autocephalous churches, each of which is governed by its bishops through local synods. The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is recognized as primus inter pares, or representative, but the church has no centralized doctrinal or governmental authority like the Pope in the Roman Catholic Church. As one of the oldest surviving religious institutions in the world, the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a significant role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and officially considers itself the Orthodox Catholic Church.

Eastern Orthodox theology is based on Holy Tradition, which encompasses the dogmatic decrees of the seven ecumenical councils, the Scriptures, and the teachings of the Church Fathers. The church maintains that it is the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church established by Jesus Christ, and its bishops are considered to be the successors of the apostles. The church recognizes seven sacraments, with the Eucharist being the principal one, and believes that consecration invoked by a priest transforms the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary is venerated as the God-bearer.

Until the East-West Schism of 1054, the churches of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch shared communion with the Church of Rome. The schism was the result of mounting theological, political, and cultural disputes, especially regarding the pope's authority. The majority of Eastern Orthodox Christians reside in Southeast and Eastern Europe, Siberia, and the Russian Far East, with half of them living in post-Soviet states like Russia. The Orthodox Church is also present in other parts of the world due to diasporas, conversions, and missionary activity.",1
"Television has been a popular form of entertainment for many decades, and it has undoubtedly had an impact on communication among friends and family. However, whether that impact has been positive or negative is a matter of debate. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family, while others believe that it has actually enhanced it in certain ways.",1
"Paul, also known as Saint Paul and Paul the Apostle, was a Christian missionary who preached the teachings of Jesus throughout the world during the first century. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age, having established multiple Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe from around the mid-40s to the mid-50s AD.

According to the book of Acts in the New Testament, Paul originally belonged to the Pharisees and took part in the persecution of early followers of Jesus, potentially Hellenist Jews who had converted to Christianity in Jerusalem. However, during a journey to Damascus to capture more Christians, Paul was struck by a bright light and experienced a vision of the risen Christ, after which he became blind. Upon receiving sight from a disciple named Ananias, Paul was baptized and began proclaiming Jesus to be the Jewish messiah and the Son of God. The book of Acts provides detailed accounts of Paul's life and works.

Paul is traditionally credited with writing 14 of the 27 books in the New Testament, though the authorship of some is disputed. Seven of the Pauline epistles are widely recognized as genuinely authored by Paul, with the rest being attributed to his followers who used his existing letters as sources. However, there is ongoing debate among scholars over the disputed authorship, particularly of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Despite this, Paul's writings continue to play a significant role in the theology and worship of many Christian traditions today.

Paul's impact on Christian thought and practice is considered to be extensive and significant compared to the other apostles and missionaries who contributed to the spread of the faith.",1
"Hydrogen is an element that is often found in nature and is the most abundant element in the universe. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and flammable gas at room temperature. Hydrogen has the atomic number 1 and is represented by the symbol H.

One of the unique properties of hydrogen is that it is the lightest element on the periodic table, making it an attractive choice for a fuel source. It is also a versatile element and can be used in various industries such as petroleum refining, chemical production, and metal processing. Additionally, it can be used in fuel cells to produce clean electricity, which has the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry.

The production of hydrogen can occur through various methods, including steam methane reforming, electrolysis, and biomass gasification. However, the production of hydrogen is currently energy-intensive, requiring large amounts of electricity to produce. This makes hydrogen production expensive and environmentally unsustainable, as most of the world's electricity supply still comes from non-renewable sources such as coal and natural gas.

Despite these challenges, hydrogen has the potential to play a significant role in the global energy transition towards a sustainable future. With advances in technology and an increasing focus on renewable energy sources, the production and utilization of hydrogen can become more efficient and cost-effective.

In conclusion, hydrogen is a versatile and abundant element that holds enormous potential as a fuel source for the future. The ongoing efforts to improve production and utilization methods present exciting opportunities for the development of a sustainable energy system.",1
"The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest was a legendary conflict between the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire in 9 AD. The battle took place in the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Lower Saxony, Germany. 

The Roman Empire, during the rule of Emperor Augustus, wanted to conquer the Germanic tribes and expand their territory. The Roman army, led by General Varus, was marching towards the Weser River when they were ambushed by a coalition of Germanic tribes led by Arminius. 

Arminius, a prince of the Cherusci tribe and a former Roman ally, had joined the Roman army to learn their tactics and strategies. He used this knowledge to his advantage and coordinated a surprise attack on the Romans. 

The battle was fierce and lasted for three days. The Romans were taken by surprise and were overwhelmed by the sudden attack. The terrain of the forest also worked against the Romans, as it was difficult for them to maneuver their troops. 

In the end, the Germanic tribes emerged victorious, with the Romans suffering a devastating defeat. General Varus and his army were completely wiped out, with around 20,000 Roman soldiers losing their lives. 

The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest had a significant impact on the Roman Empire. It prevented the expansion of their territory into Germanic lands and forced them to establish a boundary along the Rhine River. 

The battle is still remembered today as a turning point in ancient history, where an indigenous people stood up against a foreign empire and emerged victorious. The Teutoburg Forest remains a significant site and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",1

"For my part, I must argue in favor of traveling by train, because it comprises some of the main positive properties of both previously discussed approaches. Trains are very comfortable, and they don't require any effort from the passenger, neither physical, nor mental. They are also very fast, sometimes even faster than cars. Finally, trains are environmentally clean means of transportation, since they use electric power, not fossil fuels, like cars do. The superiority of traveling by train is further confirmed by the corresponding price, which is significantly higher than those of car or a bicycle travels.",0
"A motion of no confidence is when a group votes to determine whether or not they still believe a person in a position of responsibility is suited for that position. This vote can be prompted by the person's inadequacy or failure to carry out their duties. The motion is often used in government settings and can lead to the resignation of a minister or even the entire cabinet. It is distinct from a censure motion, which is a vote intended to show disapproval without necessarily resulting in resignation. In some cases, specific reasons for a censure motion must be stated, while a no-confidence motion may not require such specificity.",1
"In ancient Greek society, music was widely present, serving as an integral part of various events such as marriages, funerals, and religious ceremonies, as well as in theatre, folk music, and the recitation of epic poetry. Archaeological remains, depictions on ceramics, literary references, and fragments of actual Greek musical notation provide insight into what the music sounded like, the role of music in society, the economics of music, and the importance of a professional caste of musicians.

The word music stems from the Muses, who were the daughters of Zeus and patron goddesses of creative and intellectual ventures. The origin of music and musical instruments in ancient Greek history is highly intermingled with Greek mythology and legend, making it challenging to distinguish between what is historical fact and what is mythical.

Classical Greek music and music theory established the foundation for Western music and Western music theory, significantly influencing the ancient Romans, the early Christian church, and medieval composers. The teachings of Pythagoreans, Ptolemy, Philodemus, Aristoxenus, Aristides, and Plato remain the primary source of information on ancient Greek music theory, musical systems, and musical ethos.

Ancient Greek philosophers, including Pythagoras, discussed the study of music in ancient Greece, and the Pythagoreans believed that music was subject to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos. This idea evolved into the concept known as the music of the spheres. The Pythagoreans developed tuning systems and harmonic principles based on simple integers and ratios, focusing on the mathematics and acoustical science of sound and music. However, Aristoxenus studied music with a more empirical approach and believed that intervals should be judged by ear instead of mathematical ratios, although he still incorporated mathematical terminology and measurements.",1
"A tree is a plant with a long stem or trunk that supports branches and leaves. Some definitions restrict the label ""tree"" to woody plants with secondary growth or plants that are useful as lumber, and others include tall palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos. Trees are not a specific taxonomic group but rather a wide variety of plant species that use a trunk and branches to reach sunlight and compete with other plants. Most trees are angiosperms or hardwoods, and others are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees can live for thousands of years, and there are around three trillion mature trees in the world.

A tree typically has a strong trunk with woody and vascular tissue and is surrounded by bark. The roots extend widely in the ground to anchor the tree and extract nutrients, while the branches have smaller branches and shoots with leaves that produce food for the tree. Trees mostly reproduce from seeds or spores and can offer environmental benefits, such as reducing erosion and storing carbon. Trees also provide habitats for animals and plants, shade and shelter, construction materials, and food in the form of fruit. However, deforestation is reducing the number of trees in many parts of the world. Trees are revered in many cultures and mythologies.",1
"Color is a fascinating aspect of the world around us. It is a visual sensation caused by the interaction of light with our eyes and brain, and it can have a powerful impact on our feelings, moods, and perceptions.

There are three primary colors – red, blue, and yellow – which can be combined to create a vast array of other colors. There are also secondary colors – green, orange, and purple – which are created by combining two primary colors.

Different colors can convey different emotions and associations. Red, for example, is often associated with passion and energy, while blue is calming and serene. Yellow is often seen as cheerful and uplifting, while green is associated with nature and growth.

Colors also play an important role in art, design, and fashion. Artists use color to create mood, depth, and contrast in their compositions. Designers use color to communicate brand identity and create visual interest. And in fashion, colors can be used to create specific looks and convey different styles and moods.

Color also has practical applications in science and technology. For example, color coding is often used to organize and identify objects in a system or process. In optics, different colors of light can be used for specific applications, such as medical lasers or fiber optics.

Ultimately, color is a complex and fascinating aspect of our world. From the science of light and vision to the art of color theory and design, it is a subject that continues to inspire and captivate people from all walks of life.",1

"Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek phōs, ""light"", and synthesis, ""putting together"". Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.

Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and adenosine triphosphate, the ""energy currency"" of cells.

In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate. Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.

The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons. Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts, which is about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons, of carbon into biomass per year. That plants receive some energy from light – in addition to air, soil, and water – was first discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz.

Photosynthesis is vital for climate processes, as it captures carbon dioxide from the air and then binds carbon in plants and further in soils and harvested products. Cereals alone are estimated to bind 3,825 Tg or 3.825 Pg of carbon dioxide every year, i.e. 3.825 billion metric tons.",0

"I am from Arroz e Feijao, a small town in the northeast of Brazil. Building a factory in there will bring a lot of advantages and disadvantages, but I believe that Arroz e Feijao will mostly benefit from the building of a new factory because it is largely populated by poor people and the factory would bring many benefits to this small town. However, of course, a factory has disadvantages as well.",0
"Football, also known as soccer, is a team sport played by two teams of 11 players on a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball into the opposing side's goal. The game is traditionally played in two 45-minute halves, totaling 90 minutes. Football is considered the world's most popular sport, with approximately 250 million active players across over 200 countries.

The Laws of the Game, established in 1863 by the International Football Association Board and updated regularly, dictate the rules of the sport. The referee enforces the rules, which include the number of players per team, game length, field size, ball size, offside law, and fouls that may be penalized.

Players use primarily their feet to control, strike, or pass the ball, though any part of the body except the hands and arms may be used. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and only within the penalty area. The team with the most goals at the end of the game is the winner, with a draw declared if the same number of goals are scored. Extra time or a penalty shootout may be utilized in some formats.

FIFA governs international football, with six continental confederations operating competitions between national associations. The associations manage the sport professionally and amateurly within their respective countries and coordinate competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The men's and women's World Cup are the most prestigious international competitions.

Historically, women's football has faced opposition from some national associations. While restrictions have reduced over time, it wasn't until 1991 that the first Women's World Cup was held. The UEFA Champions League and Women's Champions League are the top European club competitions, with the men's tournament final being the most-watched annual sporting event worldwide. The top five European men's leagues are Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1, attracting the world's best players with a wage cost exceeding £600 million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion for each league.",1

"Another reason I would choose a lower-paying job with shorter hours is because I believe that personal fulfillment and happiness are important aspects of a successful and fulfilling career. While a high-paying job may bring financial success, it may not necessarily bring happiness or personal fulfillment if it requires sacrificing time with loved ones or pursuing interests outside of work. On the other hand, a lower-paying job with shorter hours would allow me to pursue my passions and interests outside of work, and would also allow me to have a better work-life balance, which could lead to greater overall satisfaction and happiness.",1
On the second place I would like to say that even if you fail you achieve much. Everybody knows that sometimes you cannot complete or even realize your goals because of the environment.

"I agree that modern technology is creating a single world culture because it disseminates knowledge beyond the geographic borders of a location. When people communicate they exchange ideas and feelings. In the ancient era, culture was passed from parents to children by spoken language. Knowledge, traditions and beliefs were transferred to the youngest through speaking and in some cases writing or drawing. Thus, at that time, culture was very restricted to the tribe, village or the community were they lived.",0
"On the other hand, those who believe that young children should spend most of their time playing argue that play is an essential part of a child's development. They believe that play allows children to develop important social skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. Play also allows children to learn about their interests and passions, which can help guide their future academic and career choices.",1

"Another difference between knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books is the way in which it is acquired. When we learn through experience, we typically do so through trial and error, making mistakes and correcting them as we go. This can be a slow and often frustrating process, but it allows us to develop a deep understanding of a subject and to learn from our mistakes. In contrast, knowledge gained from books is often more structured and linear, allowing us to absorb information at a faster pace.",1
"A chemical reaction is when two or more substances interact and create new substances. These reactions can occur naturally, like when iron rusts or leaves decompose, or they can happen in a lab setting when scientists mix different chemicals.

During a chemical reaction, the atoms in the substances become rearranged to create the new substances. This happens due to the breaking and forming of chemical bonds between the molecules. The reactants, or the substances that are being combined, are turned into products, which are the new substances that are created.

There are different types of chemical reactions, including synthesis reactions, decomposition reactions, single displacement reactions, and double displacement reactions. Each type of reaction involves different patterns of bond breaking and formation, and they can have different outcomes depending on the substances involved.

Chemical reactions are important in many areas of science and technology, including medicine, agriculture, and manufacturing. Understanding how chemical reactions work allows scientists to create new materials and medications, grow crops more efficiently, and develop new technologies that benefit society.

Overall, chemical reactions are fundamental to our understanding of the natural world and have a wide range of practical applications.",1
"I prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work. First of all, my parents have helped me to develop the habit of getting up early in the morning since I was a kid. And I see this is a good habit because by getting up early, I have more hours in a day to finish the day's work. For example, when I get up early in the morning, I would reach the office earlier. Normally, I would either have more time to finish the work or finish the work earlier and leave home earlier.",0
"Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch artist who gained immense posthumous fame as one of the most well-known figures in the Western art history. He produced over 2,000 works of art, including 1,100 drawings, nearly 900 oil paintings, landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits. His artwork is characterized by vibrant contrasts of complementary colors, expressive brushwork, and abstract lines. Van Gogh's inspiration was drawn from Japanese prints and reflected his personal symbolism, experiences, and emotions. He struggled with severe depression and psychological distress throughout his life, leading to his suicide at the age of 37.

Van Gogh began his artistic journey with still lifes and depictions of peasant laborers, which lacked the vivid colors found in his later works. During his stay in Arles in the South of France in 1888, his paintings grew brighter and more refined. However, his mental health deteriorated, and he suffered from delusions and psychotic episodes. His friendship with artist Paul Gauguin ended after an incident that resulted in Van Gogh severing a part of his left ear with a razorblade. His mental health continued to decline, leading to his hospitalization and eventual death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Van Gogh's paintings did not sell during his lifetime, and he was often considered a failure and a madman. However, his reputation grew after his death, and he is now remembered as a misunderstood genius. Today, his paintings are among the world's most expensive, and his legacy is honored by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the largest collection of his paintings and drawings.",1
"Firstly, listening to good music is the best way to escape from stress as because it takes us into a different world. While listening to the sweetly composed tunes it makes us forget all the worldly worries. Also we can listen to music anywhere using portable systems. This helps us in avoiding stress whenever we feel so. Therefore I think listening music is an excellent way to avoid stress.",0
"On the other hand, spending time with friends can be incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling. Having a strong social support system is important for mental and emotional well-being, and spending time with friends can provide a sense of belonging and connection. Friends can also be a source of support and encouragement in times of need, and can help to create memorable experiences and lasting memories. For example, someone who enjoys outdoor activities may prefer to spend their time with friends hiking or going on a camping trip.",1
"Gerhard Schröder is a former German politician who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1998 to 2005. Schröder is known for his prominent role in shaping modern German politics and for his efforts to reform the German economy.

Born in Mossenberg, Germany in 1944, Schröder began his political career as a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in the 1970s. He quickly rose through the ranks of the party, and in 1998, he was elected Chancellor of Germany.

During his time in office, Schröder implemented a number of significant reforms, including the Agenda 2010 program, which sought to modernize the German economy and social welfare system. However, Schröder's policies were controversial, and he faced criticism from both the left and the right for his reforms.

After leaving office in 2005, Schröder continued to be active in German politics, serving as a member of the European Parliament and as the chairman of the Nord Stream AG energy company.

Despite his many accomplishments, Schröder's legacy remains a subject of debate in Germany. Some see him as a key figure in Germany's economic and political transformation, while others view his policies as contributing to growing inequality and social unrest in the country.",1
"One reason why effective communication is important is that it allows us to build and maintain relationships with others. In order to build strong and lasting relationships, we need to be able to communicate effectively with others. This means being able to listen to what others have to say, understand their perspective, and respond in a way that is respectful and constructive. By developing this skill, we can build stronger relationships with our colleagues, friends, and family members, which can help us to be more successful in both our personal and professional lives.",1
"A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei, and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.

The substance initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.

Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms. Reactions may proceed in the forward or reverse direction until they go to completion or reach equilibrium. Reactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach equilibrium are often described as spontaneous and reduce the free energy if they occur at constant temperature and pressure. Non-spontaneous reactions require input of energy to go forward.

A reaction may be classified as redox in which oxidation and reduction occur or nonredox in which there is no oxidation and reduction occurring. Most simple redox reactions may be classified as combination, decomposition, or single displacement reactions.

Different chemical reactions are used during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product. In biochemistry, a consecutive series of chemical reactions form metabolic pathways. These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes. Enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions can occur at the temperature and concentrations present within a cell.

The general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decays, and reactions between elementary particles, as described by quantum field theory.",0
"One reason why quick decisions are not always wrong is that they can be based on past experience and knowledge. For example, a firefighter who has been trained to respond to emergencies quickly and make decisions under pressure is likely to make the right choice in a crisis situation, even if they don't have time to think carefully about their options. Similarly, a skilled athlete who has practiced a particular move many times may be able to make a quick decision to execute that move in a game, even if they don't have time to consider other options.",1
"On the one hand, it is certainly true that technology has made it easier for students to find and access information. In the past, students had to rely on textbooks, library books, and other physical sources of information, which could be time-consuming and inconvenient.

"1. Teachers cannot control all factors that affect student learning: A teacher's job is to educate and guide students, but there are many other factors that can impact a student's ability to learn. These include the student's home environment, their health and wellbeing, and their personal motivation and engagement with the subject matter. A teacher cannot be held solely responsible for a student's learning if there are other factors at play.",1
"Another benefit of planning is that it can help to reduce stress and uncertainty. By having a clear plan in place, individuals can feel more in control of their time and less anxious about what to do with it.

"Plastics are a diverse range of artificial or semi-artificial materials that utilize polymers as their primary component. The malleability of plastics enables them to be formed, extruded, or pressed into various shapes, making them highly versatile. Their versatility, combined with their other attributes such as lightweight, longevity, flexibility, and low cost of production, have led to their extensive use in various applications. Plastics are mainly produced through industrial processes and primarily rely on petroleum or natural gas-based chemicals. However, recent advancements in industrial techniques have made it possible to create plastic from renewable materials like cotton or corn derivatives.

Since 1950, humans have produced approximately 9.2 billion tonnes of plastic. Over half of this amount was produced after 2004, and about 400 million tonnes of plastic were produced in 2020 alone. It is expected that by 2050, plastic production will surpass 1,100 million tonnes annually due to the increasing demand for plastic.

However, the widespread use of plastic has resulted in significant environmental issues, mainly due to the slow rate of decomposition in natural environments. To tackle these problems, the plastics industry has emphasized recycling. Despite its promotion, recycling has mostly been ineffective due to the complexity required to clean and sort post-consumer plastics for reuse. Consequently, most plastic produced ends up as plastic pollution, which contaminates both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Additionally, the majority of plastic waste incinerated, with less than 10% being recycled.

The primary consumers of plastic are developed nations, where approximately a third of plastic is used in packaging and building. The medical industry also utilizes plastic, such as when creating medical devices and polymer implants. The production of plastic doubles every ten years, with every person on average responsible for approximately 50 kg of plastic each year.

The first fully synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was invented in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekeland. Over the years, various types of plastic have been developed, such as polyethylene, which is common in packaging, and polyvinyl chloride, which is useful for constructing durable pipes. Several chemists, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger and Herman Mark, have contributed to advancing the field of plastic materials science.",1
"The Social Democratic Party of Germany is a political party in Germany that leans towards the left. Along with the Union parties and the Greens, it is one of the three main political parties in Germany. Saskia Esken has been the party leader since the 2019 leadership election, with Lars Klingbeil joining her in December 2021. After the 2021 federal election, the SPD became the main party in the federal government, forming a coalition with the Greens and FDP. The SPD also holds prominent positions in 11 of the 16 German state governments.

Established in 1863, the SPD was one of the first Marxist-influenced parties in the world. It became Europe's largest Marxist party and the most popular political party in Germany from the 1890s to the early 20th century. After Germany's defeat in the First World War, the party played a leading role in the German Revolution of 1918–1919 and went on to establish the Weimar Republic. Friedrich Ebert, an SPD politician, was the first President of Germany.

When the Nazi Party rose to power, the SPD was the only party in the Reichstag that voted against the Enabling Act of 1933. It was subsequently banned and operated in exile as the Sopade. After the Second World War, the SPD was re-established, merging with the KPD to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in East Germany. In West Germany, the SPD became one of the two major political parties alongside the CDU/CSU. The SPD led the federal government several times in different coalition arrangements.

The SPD has a pro-European stance, is a member of the Party of European Socialists, and sits with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group in the European Parliament. With 16 MEPs, it is the third-largest party in the group. The SPD also founded the Progressive Alliance after leaving the Socialist International in 2013 due to its acceptance of parties violating human rights. Previously, the SPD was a founding member of both the Second International and the Labour and Socialist International.",1
"Plastics are man-made materials that can be shaped into solid objects of various shapes because of their flexibility. They are made from polymers, which is their main ingredient. They are popularly used because they are lightweight, durable, flexible, and cheap to make. Fossil fuel-based chemicals, like natural gas or petroleum, are usually used to make plastics, but recent industrial methods use renewable materials, such as corn or cotton derivatives.

About 9.2 billion tonnes of plastic have been made between 1950 to 2017, and more than half of that was produced since 2004. 400 million tonnes of plastic were produced in 2020. Annual global plastic production is estimated to reach over 1,100 million tonnes if plastic demand trends continue.

Plastics' popularity has resulted in widespread environmental issues due to their slow decomposition rate. Recycling was promoted to reduce environmental concerns, but plastic companies still produced virgin plastic to push the responsibility of plastic pollution onto consumers. Most plastic produced has not been reused, either being disposed of in landfills or polluting the environment.

Plastic is widely used in packaging, buildings, automobiles, furniture, and medical devices, with production increasing every ten years. Bakelite, the world's first fully synthetic plastic, was invented in 1907. Many different types of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride, are produced today, and many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics.",1

These include a renowned art museum, a colonial-era fort, and a number of churches and cathedrals that are architectural marvels.",1
"The Cold War is a term commonly used to refer to a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. Historians do not fully agree on its starting and ending points, but the period is generally considered to span from the announcement of the Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. The term cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945. Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.

The Western Bloc was led by the United States as well as a number of other First World nations that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of authoritarian states, most of which were their former colonies. The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World and was also tied to a network of authoritarian states. The US government supported anti-communist and right-wing governments and uprisings across the world, while the Soviet government funded left-wing parties and revolutions around the world. As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period from 1945 to 1960, they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War.

The first phase of the Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II in 1945. The United States and its allies created the NATO military alliance in 1949 in the apprehension of a Soviet attack and termed their global policy against Soviet influence containment. The Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955 in response to NATO. Major crises of this phase included the 1948–1949 Berlin Blockade, the 1945–1949 Chinese Communist Revolution, the 1950–1953 Korean War, the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the 1961 Berlin Crisis, the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and the 1964–1975 Vietnam War. The US and the USSR competed for influence in Latin America, the Middle East, and the decolonizing states of Africa, Asia, and Oceania.

Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere leading to a series of border confrontations, while France, a Western Bloc state, began to demand greater autonomy of action. The USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to suppress the 1968 Prague Spring, while the US experienced internal turmoil from the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War. In the 1960s–1970s, an international peace movement took root among citizens around the world. Movements against nuclear weapons testing and for nuclear disarmament took place, with large anti-war protests. By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of détente that saw the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the US opening relations with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the USSR. A number of self-proclaimed Marxist–Leninist governments were formed in the second half of the 1970s in the Third World, including Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and Nicaragua.

Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979. The early 1980s was another period of elevated tension. The United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from economic stagnation. In the mid-1980s, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of glasnost and perestroika and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan in 1989. Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer.

In 1989, the fall of the Iron Curtain after the Pan-European Picnic and a peaceful wave of revolutions overthrew almost all communist governments of the Eastern Bloc. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the country and was banned following an abortive coup attempt in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of its constituent republics and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia. The United States was left as the world's sole superpower.

The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to in popular culture, especially with themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare. For subsequent history, see international relations since 1989.",0

"Assembly language, also known as assembler code, is a low-level programming language that is used to program computer systems and other devices. It is a type of machine language that is specifically designed for a particular computer architecture, and is often used to optimize programs for specific hardware components.

Assembly language is considered to be a relatively simple programming language as it uses human-readable instructions that are translated into machine code. It is also considered to be faster and more efficient than high-level programming languages, such as C++ or Java, as it allows programmers to directly access the computer hardware and more finely control the execution of instructions.

Assembly language is mainly used in embedded systems, device drivers, and operating systems as it allows for direct access to the hardware and can be used to optimize performance in these scenarios. It is also used in reverse engineering and malware analysis, as it allows analysts to disassemble and analyze the machine code of software applications and find vulnerabilities or malicious code.

One of the drawbacks of assembly language is that it takes more time to write than high-level programming languages, as it requires more detailed and specific instructions. It is also difficult to learn and requires a greater understanding of computer architecture and instruction sets.

Despite its challenges, assembly language remains an important tool for programming in certain scenarios and is still widely used in many industries. Its ability to optimize performance and directly access hardware make it a valuable resource for developers and programmers alike.",1
"A constitutional monarchy is a system of government in which a monarch acts as the head of state within the parameters set out by a constitution. The monarch's role is largely ceremonial, representing the country at national and international events, and performing symbolic duties such as opening Parliament or conferring honors on citizens. In this system, the real power is held by the elected government and parliament.

The concept of a constitutional monarchy dates back centuries, with examples including the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Spain, and Japan. Many of these countries have evolved their constitutional monarchies over time, adapting to changes in society and politics.

One of the main advantages of a constitutional monarchy is the continuity it provides. The monarch is a figurehead that transcends political parties and changing governments, giving a sense of stability to the country. This can be especially important during times of crisis or change, providing a unifying force for the nation.

Depending on the details of the constitution, a constitutional monarchy can also offer a system of checks and balances on the power of the government. By having a separate head of state with some degree of influence, it can prevent the government from becoming too despotic or authoritarian.

On the other hand, critics of constitutional monarchy argue that it is an outdated and unnecessary system, symbolizing a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of an unelected individual who is given a privileged position in society. Others argue that the presence of a monarchy perpetuates an elitist culture that disadvantages certain sections of society.

Overall, a constitutional monarchy can be an effective system of government if the monarch's role is clearly defined within a modern and democratic constitution. It can provide a sense of continuity and stability while also offering checks and balances on the power of the government. However, it is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of this system, and to ensure that it is appropriate for the unique circumstances of each country.",1
"The Himalayas, or Himalaya, is a mountain range in Asia, separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has some of the planet's highest peaks, including the very highest, Mount Everest. Over 100 peaks exceeding 7,200 m in elevation lie in the Himalayas. By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia is 6,961 m tall.

The Himalayas abut or cross five countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, and Pakistan. The sovereignty of the range in the Kashmir region is disputed among India, Pakistan, and China. The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the world's major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo–Brahmaputra, rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people; 53 million people live in the Himalayas. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism; the summits of several—Kangchenjunga, Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare, Nanda Devi and Kailas in the Tibetan Transhimalaya—are off-limits to climbers.

Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River.

"In the 2016 United States presidential election, held on November 8th, Donald Trump and Mike Pence won against Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, causing one of the biggest upsets in American history. This was the 58th quadrennial presidential election and marked the fifth presidential election where the winner lost the popular vote. The Libertarian Party nominated Gary Johnson and the Green Party nominated Jill Stein. Trump's campaign promised to ""Make America Great Again"" and went against political correctness, illegal immigration, and many free-trade agreements, gaining widespread media coverage. Clinton emphasized her political experience, advocated for expanding Obama's policies, and denounced Trump and his supporters. The election campaign was divisive and negative, with controversies surrounding both candidates. On Election Day, Trump won several swing states, flipping Ohio, Florida, and Iowa, and won the electoral vote with 304 votes, while Clinton received 227. Johnson received nearly 4.5 million votes, the highest nationwide share for a third-party candidate since Ross Perot, and Stein received almost 1.45 million votes. Independent candidate Evan McMullin received over 732,000 votes and 21.4% of the vote in his home state of Utah, the highest share for a third-party candidate in any state.

Even if someone was unbelievably lucky enough to become a manager not being qualified enough, he will be asked to resign in the near future because of his inability due to lack of knowledge and experience to make right decisions. For instance, I used to work for a very small company owned by a friend. This company was later closed because of bankruptcy. The cause of bankruptcy was wrong strategies and decisions made by the owner. After the failure, he went to a university and worked for another company so that he could obtain experience and become a successful businessman. Nowadays, he considers himself a successful person because he had turned into reality his two biggest dreams of producing consumer goods of high quality and making charitable donations to needy people.",0
"It is my opinion that science is more appreciated than art by the modern society. There are several reasons that lead to this conclusion. People find it easier to accept information in material, than in spiritual form. For example, using typical products of science, such as computers or TVs, doesn't require much mental effort, while art can sometimes be obscure and hard to grasp. Furthermore, in many countries, science receives generous financial support from the government, while art seldom does. This is because a country's military and economic power is dominantly affected by its science, not art. Therefore, scientists are played much better than artists. In fact, having art as a sole profession is very unlikely to provide enough money to support a family, for instance. Even though some people become fascinated with art classes while in school, later in life they are usually forced to move towards more scientific fields of work, such as economics or engineering.",0
